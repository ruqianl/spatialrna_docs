Image-based spatial transcriptomics provide gene expression measurements in tissue slices at single-molecule resolution with spatial context preserved. Modern Graph Neural Network (GNN) models are promising methods for capturing the complex molecular and cellular phenotypes in tissues at single-transcript and single-cell levels. A key application of GNNs is the detection of spatial domains or niches, that is, groups of molecules and/or cells that collaboratively work together to produce complex phenotypes. Due to the vast number of detected transcripts in image-based spatial transcriptomics, applying GNNs on RNA molecule graphs is not trivial. 

`SpatialRNA` is a Python package designed for easy graph and subgraph generations from spatial RNA molecules in tissue samples ([Lyu et al,2025](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.20.644258)).
